# 🧠 TinyML-Powered Home Energy Management System (HEMS)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simulation of **AI and TinyML integration in a Home Energy Management System (HEMS)**, aimed at optimizing power consumption in smart environments. It combines **IoT sensing**, **local AI inference**, and **web-based control** to offer real-time, intelligent decision-making at the edge — without relying on continuous cloud connectivity.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Reduce energy consumption through intelligent automation.
- Enable **offline AI-powered decisions** via TinyML models on microcontrollers.
- Integrate a voice-controlled interface (Google Home) and a live dashboard for smart monitoring and control.
- Simulate user data, train AI models, and deploy them on-device for real-time inference.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32-S3
- **AI/ML Platform**: Edge Impulse (TinyML model training & deployment)
- **Programming**: C++, Python, Arduino
- **APIs & Comms**: REST API, WebSocket, MQTT, JSON
- **Voice Assistant**: Google Home + IFTTT
- **UI**: Web Dashboard (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- **Database**: Firebase (optional for extended cloud logs)

---

## 🧪 Key Features
- 📡 **Sensor Integration**: Real-time temperature, light, and motion sensors
- 🔌 **Edge AI**: TinyML model deployed locally on ESP32 to automate decision-making
- 💡 **Smart Control**: Automated switching of lights/fans based on occupancy & thresholds
- 🧠 **Energy Analytics**: Live tracking and basic prediction of energy usage
- 🗣️ **Voice Activation**: Google Home integration for manual overrides
- 🌐 **Web Dashboard**: User-friendly frontend with real-time state feedback

---

## ✅ Results
- Model accuracy: **87.5%** on real-world test data
- Power consumption simulated to drop by **up to 28%** in common idle scenarios
- System remains **functional offline** while syncing to cloud services when available
- Built for **modularity and scalability** — additional appliances/sensors can be added easily
